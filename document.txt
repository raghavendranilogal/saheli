TRAINING TOOL KIT
INTRODUCTION
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) has launched Anemia Mukt Bharat Programme 
with special focus on the health and nutrition needs of children, adolescents, women of reproductive age 
group and pregnant mothers and lactating mothers. 
This will be achieved through six interventions, implementation of which will be facilitated by six robust 
institutional mechanisms. T o facilitate seamless implementation of the interventions, a training tool kit has been developed which will be used to orient and train different stakeholders at various levels for effective implementation of Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy. 
Guiding principles:  
i. Beneficiary centred approach: Commitment to improve health outcomes and reduce anemia 
prevalence among the target age groups
ii. Inclusive partnerships: Facilitate participation of all stakeholders to achieve the common goal
iii. Accountability: Commitment to inculcate accountability for service delivery among all  
service providers
iv. Minimizing duplication: Leverage existing institutional mechanisms for capacity building processes

 5Anemia is present when there is less haemoglobin levels as per age and sex
 5Anemia leads to poor health, economic loss and social burden
 5Anemia can be diagnosed by estimation of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the blood and clinical 
signs and symptoms
 5Anemia is caused by nutritional deficiency, infections and genetic illnesses leading to poor 
production, more destruction of red blood cells or blood loss 
 5The signs and symptoms of anemia may not be clinically visible until anemia status is severe. However, negative health consequences occur even before the onset of severe anemia
 5The prevalence of anemia across all ages has been more than 50% amongst the vulnerable groups in India and in the last 10 years, the percentage point reduction of anemia prevalence 
has been extremely low in most age groups
 5Anemia control programme in India started in 1970 as National Nutritional Anemia 
Prophylaxis Program (NNAPP) and evolved in 2018 as Anemia Mukt Bharat.Points to remember:

 Step 1: Remind the participants about the six interventions in “Anemia Mukt Bharat” campaign 
 Step 2: Tell them “testing of hemoglobin using digital hemoglobinometers and Point of Care 
treatment of anemia” is a new intervention under Anemia Mukt Bharat campaign. Mass 
screening for anemia amongst the vulnerable age groups is imperative for initiation of 
appropriate treatment as per the severity of anemia.
 Step 3: Tell them the devices for testing of anemia at facility level and field level are as follows:
1. At the facility level (block level and above):
 •Hemoglobin level estimation will by using Semi-Auto Analysers.
2. At the health facilities below block level (where haematology analysers are  not available) and field level:
 •Digital hemoglobinometer will be used for testing of hemoglobin level. The digital hemoglobinometers are point of care testing devices, as they can be used for 
estimation of hemoglobin, near the beneficiary (for example, at his/her home) 
outside the hospital. Activity 1: Why to use point of care devices

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module28Facilitator’s Guide 2.2
Consumption of IFA supplementation: Things to remember
IFA tablets to be taken preferably about one hour after major meals to prevent side effects  
such as nausea.
Beneficiaries complaining of side effects are advised to take the IFA supplements after 
dinner and before sleeping.
IFA supplement should be consumed along with foods rich in vitamin C such as lemon in the 
form of nimbu-paani, amla  (Indian gooseberry) etc. for improving the absorption of iron.
Drinking of tea or coffee within an hour of consuming IFA should be discouraged, as it may reduce the iron absorption.
Iron and calcium tablets should not be consumed together, as calcium interferes in iron 
absorption. At least two hours of interval should be there between calcium and iron tablet 
consumption. Step 10:   With the help of Facilitator’s Guide 2.2,  explain the important information while 
consuming IFA supplementationWomen of 
reproductive age 
group •States are encouraged to integrate provision of IFA tablets, folic acid 
tablets and deworming to WRA through immunization day/VHND 
platform wherever feasible
 •To begin, 20-24 years WRA will be provided IFA tablet in Nayi Pehal Kit using Mission Parivar Vikas platform 
 •States should ensure preparation of eligible couple register 
 •ASHA	will	mobilize	target	beneficiaries	(WRA)	to	 VHNDs	–	 ANM	will	
counsel them on IFA consumption and deworming (albendazole) to 
prevent anemia 
 •If the WRA is planning for pregnancy, she should be counselled to stop IFA supplementation and initiate Folic acid supplementation and continue 
till 12 weeks of pregnancy (first trimester) 
 •Folic acid tablets will be provided at VHNDs/SCs by ANM.
Pregnant women IFA tablets will be provided through antenatal care contacts (ANC clinics/
VHND/PMSMA)
Lactating women IFA tablets through VHND platform when they bring their child for immunization 
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module29Session 2: Deworming
Facilitator’s Guide 2.3
Deworming
Soil-transmitted	helminths	–	which	include	roundworms	(Ascaris lumbricoides ), whipworms 
(Trichuris trichiura ) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale )	–	are	
among the common causes of infestation in people who live in the developing world.
Soil-transmitted helminths impair the nutritional status of an individual by multiple ways 
including:
 •Feeding on host tissues, including blood, which leads to a loss of iron and protein
 •Internal bleeding which can lead to loss of iron, intestinal inflammation and obstruction
 •Diarrhoea
 •Impairment of nutrient intake, digestion and absorption
Due to poor hygiene and open defecation practices, worm infestation has a high prevalence in our country across all ages.
Worm infestation (particularly hookworm infestation) along with nutritional deficiency is an 
important cause of anemia and thus deworming is an important intervention for prophylaxis 
for anemia.Step 1: Lead the discussion by asking:
1. Why deworming is important for prevention and treatment of anemia?
2. Add the missing information using Facilitator’s Guide 2.3Activity 1: Deworming: Why and how
Duration: 30 minutes
Objectives: 
After the session, the participants will be: Sensitized on the importance of 
deworming in prevention and treatment of anemia

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module31 5IFA supplementation helps to replenish the body stores and meets the needs of the body at 
all ages, irrespective of anemia status
 5IFA supplement should be consumed along with foods rich in vitamin C for better absorption
 5Worm infestation (particularly hookworm infestation) along with nutritional deficiencies is an 
important cause of anemia
 5Bi-annual dose of 400 mg albendazole (1 tablet) is given for deworming in all the age groups 
except children of 12 months to 24 months, wherein half the dose (Tablet Albendazole 200 
mg) is given
 5In pregnant women, one dose of 400 mg albendazole (1 tablet), after the first trimester, preferably during the second trimester
 5It is important taking iron-rich foods viz. meat, fish, egg, poultry, green leafy vegetables (mustard, fenugreek (methi), bathua, amaranth leaves, radish leaves), whole pulses (Bengal 
gram whole, horse gram whole, etc.) and cereals (whole wheat flour, bajra, ragi, jowar). Inclusion of vitamin C rich foods like fruits (gooseberry, guava, lemon, orange, raw mango), 
vegetables (drumstick leaves, amaranth leaves, capsicum) and sprouts help in improving iron 
absorption. This helps in prevention of anemia.Points to remember:

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module39Facilitator’s Guide 2.4
Parenteral iron therapy
Why parenteral iron therapy
Oral IFA supplementation is often associated with poor compliance mainly due to side 
effects such as vomiting, nausea, constipation, indigestion, etc.
Parenteral iron treatment circumvents the natural gastrointestinal regulatory mechanisms to 
deliver non-protein bound iron to the red blood cells. Intra-venous (IV) iron helps in achieving 
rapid correction of hemoglobin and iron stores, and is better tolerated than oral iron in treating iron deficiency anemia.
Iron sucrose formulation Iron sucrose is the most common formulation used for parenteral iron therapy .Iron sucrose is a non-dextran intravenous iron formulation with a complex of polynuclear 
iron	(III)	–	hydroxide	core	bounded	by	sucrose. 	It	has	short	half-life	of 	5–6	hours, 	which	
is responsible for relatively rapid erythropoiesis and can provide quick rise in hemoglobin 
within 5 to 7 days.
Indications
Intra-venous Iron Sucrose (IVIS) may be considered as the first line of management in 
individuals identified with the following conditions:
I. Moderate anemia during pregnancy (after the first trimester of pregnancy) and during 
postpartum period if:
 •Oral iron is not tolerated 
 •Non-compliance to oral iron 
 •No improvement in hemoglobin level or improvement less than 1gm/dL after one month  
 of oral IFA treatment 
II. Severe anemia (Hb 6.9 to 5 gm/dL) during 13 to 34 weeks of pregnancy 
Contraindications: 
I. Patients with evidence of iron overload 
II. Patients with known hypersensitivity to iron preparation or any of its component
III. Patients with anemia not caused by iron deficiency
IV . Liver disorder like jaundice, cirrhosis or renal failure 
V . Acute cardiac failure
VI. Known case of thalassemia, sickle cell anemia or hemolytic anemia
Iron sucrose administration: Dos and don’ts
 •Iron sucrose is available in 5 ml vial, with 20 mg of elemental iron per ml of iron sucrose.
 •IV iron sucrose should be administered as a slow infusion of 200 mg/dose in 100 ml 0.9% 
saline administered over 20-30 minutes. 
 •During the first five minutes, infusion should be given at the rate of 20-30 drops/minute and then increased to 80-90 drops/minute.
 •Subsequent doses can be given over a period of 20 to 25 minutes. It is important to 
administer the drug at this rate since too slow or too fast rates have been associated with 
side effects.
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module40 Step 6: Conclude the activity by thanking the participants and tell them they will be learning more 
about parenteral therapy of anemia during pregnancy in the next activity .
Duration: 45 minutes
Objectives: 
After the session, the participants will be able to:
 •describe the importance of parenteral iron therapy
 •identify the conditions where parenteral iron therapy is indicated
 •provide treatment of anemia with intravenous iron sucrose in pregnancy 
Materials Required:
Chart papers, Markers, PowerPoint presentation, LCDMethodology :
Discussion, PowerPoint presentation, ExerciseActivity 2: Parenteral iron therapy during pregnancy •Maximum dose should not exceed 600 mg (3 doses of 200 mg each) of iron sucrose in  a week.
 •Iron sucrose should be administered at primary health care or higher level of health care 
under the supervision of the medical officer.
 •Vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and foetal heart 
rate should be monitored before, during (every 5 minutes after initiation of infusion) and at 
the end of the infusion.
 •The expected increase in hemoglobin level for pregnant women with severe and moderate anemia is approximately 2.5 gm/dL and 1.6 gm/dL, respectively after 3 weeks of complete 
dose of IV iron sucrose treatment. 
 •To avoid permanent discolouration of the skin due to extravasation of IVIS, patency of the cannula has to be checked by flushing normal saline before initiation of treatment.
Precautions 
 •All lifesaving equipment should be kept available to deal with any unexpected severe adverse reaction.
 •Hand hygiene shall be performed before and after the contact with pregnant women.
 •Use sterile and disposable intravenous (IV) infusion set, venflon and syringe.
 •Patency of IV cannula has to be ensured, otherwise extravasation of iron could lead to 
permanent staining of skin.
 •Discard the remaining unused drug in the vial after withdrawing the required dose. Do not store the remaining IV iron sucrose for later use.
 •In case of any reaction, administer one ampoule of inj. Avil (Pheniramine) and one vial of inj. Hydrocortisone intravenously immediately and contact the medical officer on duty .
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module41Handout 1
Treatment of anemia using intravenous iron sucrose during pregnancy
Indications
Parenteral therapy using intravenous iron sucrose during pregnancy is indicated in:Moderate anemia during pregnancy (after the first trimester of pregnancy) and during 
postpartum period if:
 •Oral iron is not tolerated 
 •No improvement in hemoglobin level or improvement less than 1gm/dL after one month of 
oral IFA treatment 
Dosage calculation:
Iron requirement for intravenous administration of iron sucrose can be calculated using 
Ganzoni’s formula.
Total iron deficit (mg) = Body weight* (kg) x (target Hb in gm/dL**– actual Hb in gm/
dL) x 2.4 + 500***
*Pre-pregnancy weight. If pre-pregnancy weight is not available, weight recorded during the first visit of 
first trimester can be used
**Target Hb for pregnant women = 11.0 gm/dL
***500 mg for replenishing iron stores in the body of women weighing 35 kg
If the pregnant women’s weight is less than 35 kg, allowance for iron store = 15mg/kg body 
weight)
Example:If a pregnant woman has a weight of 60 kg (pre-pregnant weight) a hemoglobin level 9.5 
gm/dL:
Total iron deficit = 60 x (11.0-9.5) x 2.4 + 500 = 716 mgSimplified method:A total dose of 200 mg of iron sucrose (10 ml of Iron Sucrose) can be infused at a time Step 1: Welcome the participants and tell them they will be learning about treatment of anemia 
using intravenous iron sucrose during pregnancy .
 Step 2:   Run the PowerPoint presentation and answer the queries, if any .
 Step 3:   Distribute Handout 1: Treatment of anemia using intravenous iron sucrose during pregnancy .

Documentation and post-infusion management
Document the dose, date of infusion and side effects (if any) observations in the Antenatal 
clinic (ANC) record and Mother and Child Protection Card (MCPC) of the pregnant woman. The 
pregnant woman should be observed for 1 hour after infusion and can be discharged on the 
same day if all vitals are stable.
Follow-up of after iron sucrose administrationThe hemoglobin level of the pregnant woman should be checked 4 and 6 weeks after 
administration of iron sucrose. If there is no change in hemoglobin levels at the end of IV iron 
sucrose treatment, other causes of anemia should be investigated.

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module46 5Mild and moderate anemia can be effectively treated by oral iron folic acid therapy in all age 
groups and pregnancy in recommended doses.
 5After the hemoglobin levels come to normal, prophylactic IFA dose should be provided along with counselling.
 5All cases with no improvement in Hb level after oral iron folic acid therapy for recommended duration, should be referred to FRU/ district hospital.
 5Parenteral iron therapy for anemia is done using Intra-venous Iron Sucrose (IVIS).
 5Intra-venous Iron Sucrose (IVIS) is considered as the first line of management in individuals with severe anemia (Hb 6.9 to 5.0 gm/dL) between 13-34 weeks of gestational age. 
 5Iron sucrose is contraindicated in patients with evidence of iron-over load, known hypersensitivity to iron preparation or any of its components or non-iron deficiency anemia. 
 5During pregnancy, Intra-venous Iron Sucrose (IVIS) may be considered in moderate anemia 
where, diagnosis of anemia in late stages of pregnancy, no tolerance to oral iron, no 
improvement in hemoglobin level (Hb level <1gm/dL) after one month of oral IFA treatment, 
noncompliance for oral IFA tablets and also for anemia in postpartum period. 
 5The dose of iron sucrose is calculated with Ganzoni’s formula. 
 5The treatment has to be spread over 2-3 weeks, with 3 doses per week. 
 5The pregnant woman should be observed for 1 hour after infusion for any side effects.
 5The hemoglobin level of the pregnant woman should be checked 4 and 6 weeks after administration of iron sucrose.Points to remember:

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module49Duration: 30 minutesPart I:  T elling a story using the story cards 
Using the story cards narrate the following story: Shanta’s Story
Story card 1: Poonam, the ASHA of Rampur Sub 
Health Centre (SC), was concerned that a large 
number of women and adolescents in the block 
were anemic and many infants were malnourished. 
She always took the opportunity to motivate them 
whenever they visited the SC. She ensured that 
she explained the importance of taking IFA tablets 
regularly and talking to them about the importance 
of having an iron rich diet. She also supported 
other ASHAs in her area to motivate pregnant and 
lactating women and their families to ensure that 
IFA tablets are taken as prescribed.
Story card 2: Shanta, who was about to enter the 
fourth month of her pregnancy had come to the PHC from a nearby village for her first antenatal 
check-up. Her husband also accompanied her. 
After registering the pregnancy and conducting 
all the necessary check-ups, Pooja the ANM at the 
PHC explained the need for and benefits of taking 
one IFA tablet – the red tablet – daily for the next 180 
days (six months). Shanta said that she understood 
the benefits of taking IFA tablets regularly but told 
Poonam that her family, especially her mother-in-
law, did not trust IFA tablets. Her sister-in-law who 
had consumed IFA tablets during her pregnancy used to complain of nausea and also passed black 
coloured stools. She had therefore, discontinued 
taking IFA tablets. Also, both her mother and her 
mother-in-law believed that taking IFA tablets may 
result in the baby developing a dark complexion

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module50Story card 3: In a friendly and caring manner, Pooja 
explained to Shanta that taking IFA tablets regularly 
was very important to ensure the good health of 
the mother as well as the baby in the womb. She 
gave her a strip of IFA tablets and also explained 
the need to take an iron-rich diet such as green 
leafy vegetables, whole grains and pulses, nuts and 
oilseeds along with meat, eggs, liver and fish (if the 
family consumes non-vegetarian food). She further 
explained that including vitamin C-rich foods such 
as lemons, tomatoes, guavas, oranges, amlas and 
sprouts help in absorption of iron in the body. She cheerfully explained that the benefits of taking IFA 
tablets were far greater than the few discomforts 
that one might face initially after consuming the 
tablets. Shanta assured Pooja that she would try to 
convince her mother-in-law to let her take the IFA 
tablets.
Story card 4: About two weeks later, Pooja 
visited Shanta’s village as part of the routine 
supportive supervision provided to ASHAs. During 
her conversation with Poonam, the village ASHA, 
about the status of pregnant women in the 
village, she remembered to check about Shanta. 
Poonam reported that she had visited Shanta 
and motivated her to start taking one IFA tablet everyday, preferably at the same time without fail. 
She also told Pooja that although Shanta was keen 
to start, she had been hesitant to take IFA tablets 
and that her visit to Shanta’s place and explanation 
to Shanta’s mother-in-law of the benefits of taking 
IFA tablets had helped Shanta to start taking them. 
Pooja decided to visit Shanta’s house along with 
Poonam.

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module51Story card 5: After exchanging pleasantries 
with Shanta’s mother-in-law, Pooja and Poonam 
enquired about Shanta. She complained that Shanta 
experienced headaches and nausea after she started 
taking IFA tablets and that she did not want her 
grandchild to face any problems due to the mother’s 
condition. She told Pooja and Poonam that Shanta had 
stopped taking IFA tablets now. While they were talking, 
Shanta came in offering water to both. She looked very 
pale and tired.
Story card 6: Together, Pooja and Poonam explained 
the benefits of IFA tablets once again and the grave 
dangers that it protected both mother and child 
from. They gave examples of their own pregnancies 
and how they had faced the same problems while 
taking IFA tablets and that after some time they had 
become used to them. The side effects of the tablets 
also reduced in some time. Poonam was carrying a set 
of dialogue cards that she used effectively to explain 
why taking IFA tablets regularly along with an iron and vitamin C-rich diet (which includes dark green leafy 
vegetables, locally produced fruits and vegetables like 
pumpkin, papaya, orange, lemon and guavas) was very 
important for the health of the mother and the baby. 
Story card 7: Thereafter, Pooja and Poonam decided to 
meet Shanta’s husband Ramlal who ran a small grocery 
shop nearby. They went to meet him with the village 
Pradhan whose daughter-in-law had recently delivered 
a healthy baby in the PHC. They patiently explained 
all the benefits of regular IFA tablet consumption to Shanta’s husband and requested him to ensure 
Shanta took the tablets regularly. They also explained 
that an anemic person may feel lethargic, experience 
breathlessness, giddiness or weakness and get tired 
easily. The village Pradhan helped in motivating Shanta’s 
husband by narrating how his daughter-in-law and the 
newborn were both healthy because they had followed 
all the advice given by the ASHA and ANM didis. Poonam 
also requested Ramlal to bring Shanta to the PHC for her 
next ANC check-up which was due after two months.

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module52Story card 8: During the next visit, both Ramlal and 
his mother accompanied Shanta to the PHC where 
along with other check-ups, Pooja also checked 
Shanta’s haemoglobin levels. The results were 
satisfactory. This was a result of Shanta taking her 
daily dose of IFA tablets without fail. Now her family 
also supported her in ensuring she took an iron-rich 
diet along with daily IFA supplementation.
Story card 9: Shanta delivered a healthy child at 
the PHC after a few months. All the steps related to 
healthy delivery such as delayed cord clamping 
and early initiation of breastfeeding were ensured 
by the medical team attending to Shanta. Pooja, as a capable team member, counselled Shanta and 
her family members on continuing consumption of 
IFA tablets for another 180 days (six months) as it is 
equally important for lactating mothers to take IFA 
tablets as it is for pregnant women. Not only does 
Shanta take her IFA tablets regularly but she also 
motivates other pregnant women and lactating 
mothers in her village to take IFA tablets without fail 
during pregnancy and lactation.
Once you have completed narrating the story, ask the following questions:
1. What did you think of the story? Do you find families like Shanta’s 
who are reluctant to follow your advice?
2. How did Pooja handle the case? Did she try to find out the reasons 
for Shanta’s mother-in-law not supporting consumption of IFA 
tablets? Did Shanta’s family accept her advice?
3. How did Pooja finally convince the family and win Shanta’s support in 
promoting health care? 
4. What is it that Pooja could have done better? (Like counselling the 
family regarding possible side effects of taking IFA tablets) 

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module53Once you have completed narrating the story, ask the following questions:Allow sufficient time for participants to reflect and share their views on each of the above questions. 
Keep asking questions to elicit the following:
 •During Shanta’s first visit to the PHC, Poonam was able to create an ‘awareness’ as well as a ‘desire’ in Shanta to start taking IFA tablets. But her mother-in-law influenced Shanta and 
dissuaded her.
 •When Poonam visited Shanta at her home, she was able to convince Shanta and her mother-
in-law so that Shanta could start taking IFA tablets. Thus, Poonam was able to get Shanta and 
her mother-in-law to agree to test the ‘desired’ behaviour change.
 •But again, the fact that Shanta felt nauseated and experienced headaches and also that they were not fully convinced about the cause, caused Shanta to discontinue taking IFA tablets.
 •Again, Pooja and Poonam influenced and motivated the family by talking to Shanta’s mother-in-law and taking the village Sarpanch to meet Ramlal, Shanta’s husband and convince him. 
They were successful in convincing the family to get Shanta to start taking IFA tablets daily .
 •In this manner, the family realized that it was good to take IFA tablets daily and to follow the 
advice of the ASHA and ANM. Shanta continued to take IFA tablets daily and started availing 
other services, thereby ‘sustaining’ the behaviour change.
 •Finally, Shanta also starting ‘advocating’ for both pregnant women and lactating mothers to take IFA tablets regularly .
Duration: 30 minutesPart II:  Presenting the first chart depicting the seven steps in 
behaviour change 
Leading from the discussions on Shanta’s story in Part I, initiate discussion on the behaviour change process.

The Behaviour  
Change ProcessDropouts

DropoutsDropoutsDropoutsDropouts
Awareness
Desire
Knowledge 
Skill
Tries Out RepeatsMaintainSustainStep 1  in the change 
process is to become 
AWARE  of the change 
that needs to take place. 
Write ‘Aware’ on the board 
and discuss how Shanta 
became aware about the 
fact that taking IFA tablets 
is beneficial for all women. 
This awareness could 
come from a neighbour, 
a relative or a friend or 
through the ASHA/AWW 
or any other functionary 
(using IEC materials 
such as dialogue cards, 
pamphlet or recipe book 
etc.). It could also be 
through	the	media	–	
newspaper, radio or TV . 
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module54Once the same message is heard several times (e.g. every woman and girl should take IFA tablets 
regularly, every child should be immunised, every child should be in school, institutional deliveries 
are safest for mother and child, etc.), one develops a DESIRE  to test the change. This is Step 2  of the 
change process. Write ‘Desire’ on the board as shown in the chart and draw an arrow indicating that 
awareness leads to a desire for change. 
Now that one desires the change, one will look at ways to make the change and this could 
be acquiring a new SKILL  (as in the case of the skill to breastfeed a baby the right way) or 
KNOWLEDGE  (as in the case of finding out when and where one’s child can be immunized or when 
an IFA tablet should be taken).
An enabling environment consists of:
 •Supportive family, relatives and neighbours.
 •Functionaries and volunteers and other opinion leaders through their sustained 
encouragement, through counselling and dialogue and provision of quality services.
 •The media through repeated supportive messaging in jingles, spots, hoardings and wall 
paintings.
Therefore, Step 3  is acquiring the necessary skill or knowledge to make the behaviour change. Write 
‘Knowledge’ (in Shanta’s case the knowledge was where to get IFA tablets as well as knowing that it 
had to be taken every day) or ‘Skill’ (as in the case of being able to breastfeed a child the right way) 
on the board as shown in the chart and draw an arrow to indicate that desire leads to acquiring the 
necessary knowledge and/or skill to make that change.
Now that one has acquired the knowledge and/or the skill, Step 4  will be to TRY OUT  that change 
(e.g. starting to consume IFA tablets as advised by the ASHA or AWW). Write ‘Try out’ on the board 
as shown in the chart and discuss this as the fourth step in the change process. Individuals analyse 
the experience of trying out the change behaviour and if the assessment is negative (as in Shanta’s 
case), the person drops out from the process.
If it is positive, the tendency is to try it out once again. In other words, REPEAT  the action. This is  
Step 5  of the cycle. Write ‘Repeat’ on the board as shown in the diagram and discuss the same with 
the participants.
If it is negative, like black stools or nausea after taking iron tablets, chances of falling back are high. 
At this time, the person requires support, solutions, explanations and motivation from the functionary 
or family to try again and repeat the action.
If the experience of Step 5 was good, one will tend to repeat the action; in other words, MAINTAIN  
(Step 6)  the behaviour and soon it becomes a SUSTAINED  (Step 7)  behaviour change or a habit. 
Write ‘Maintain’ and ‘Sustain’ on the board as in the chart with the arrows linking them and discuss 
these steps with the participants.
The behaviour change process is thus completed.
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module55Part III:  Sharing of personal experiences in changing 
behaviour by participants
Duration: 30 minutes
Duration: 30 minutesDivide the participants into groups of six or seven members each. Request each participant to share 
any one of their personal experiences in changing a health or nutrition related behaviour (encourage 
them to share any experiences related to adopting behaviours that cure anemia) or acquiring a new 
behaviour with the other members of their group. Request participants to share their experiences 
keeping in mind the steps discussed and listed in Part II.

Once each member in the group has shared her/his experience, ask each group to select one of the 
experiences shared within the group and share it with the other groups. One member from the group 
has to present the experience.
One member of each group presents one of the experiences from her/his group. They are given five 
minutes each. Group members should be requested to supplement the presentation by their groups. Part IV: Presentations from groups and discussion
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module56Summarize participants’ experiences in terms of the role played by them at each stage of the change 
process. This will help them understand how there is a definite role to play at each step.
Give sufficient time for participants to discuss each question and highlight the key points arising from 
the discussions.
Show the earlier diagram of the change process and explain/discuss their role at each step.
Concluding the Session
Using the diagram that was drawn in Part II of the session and the discussions from Part III, 
complete the chart indicating that at any step of the cycle one could drop out from the change 
process, unless there is someone motivating and ‘facilitating’ the person to make that particular 
change.
This is where the Medical Officer (MO)/Staff Nurse/ANM or any other worker should monitor and 
support the individual to carry on with the change process. We know of many cases where women 
and adolescent girls drop out after taking IFA tablets for the first few days. If we are to prevent such 
dropouts, we need to follow up with each family ‘at risk’ of anemia and support them in understanding 
the need for the changed behaviour. Therefore, it is critical that an ENABLING ENVIRONMENT  is 
created and sustained to help individuals, families and communities make the desired change. An 
enabling environment would consist of the following:Once you have completed narrating the story, ask the following questions:
1. Whether they were aware of the different steps of the change 
process discussed in Part II while they underwent the change.
2. Whether any member had tried a changed behaviour and given up at any stage of the process. Allow sufficient time to elicit the fact 
that people drop out and give up. Discuss what the reasons could 
be for giving up.
3. Whether there was someone motivating them or inspiring them to 
go ahead with each step of the change process. 
Supportive relatives 
and neighbours.Functionaries and volunteers and other opinion leaders through their sustained 
encouragement through counselling 
and dialoguing and provision of quality 
services.The media (press, radio, 
TV etc.) through supportive 
messaging.
In conclusion, ask the participants how they found the entire session. Ask them what the major 
learning outcomes were and whether they were able to relate to the behaviour change process. Tell 
them that we will be building on the concept further and working on behaviour change.1 2 3
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module57Once you have completed narrating the story, ask the following questions:
Emphasize that the communicator plays an important role at every step of the change process. 
In the case of Shanta, the ANM Poonam had first discussed the issue with Shanta at the PHC. 
When this did not work, she went to her house and spoke to her husband and her mother-in-
law and convinced them about the importance of taking IFA tablet. When the child missed the 
second dose, she brought the Sarpanch and two of Ramlal’s friends and convinced the family . 
Thus, at each stage, we have to be very conscious that the individual or family could drop out 
and therefore we need to monitor them and ensure that we continue with our efforts to bring 
about behaviour change with supportive strategies.Tips for the Facilitator

have. Prepare a checklist of how these materials can be used on a flip chart.
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module59Handout 2: How to Use AMB Communication Materials
Audience: Adolescent Girls, Pregnant and Lactating Women,  
 WRA, Husbands, Fathers, Mother-in-law
Audience: Adolescents and ParentsHOW TO USE DIALOGUE CARDS
HOW TO USE BOOKLET •Position the dialogue cards in such a place 
that a small group can see it. Or, circulate the 
cards around the group.
 •Point to the pictures and not to the written content.
 •Face the audience (for group talks). Move around the room with the dialogue cards if the 
whole group cannot see them at one time. Try 
to involve the group.
 •Ask the audience questions about the 
illustrations to check their understanding.
 •If the dialogue card has text, use it as a guide but familiarize yourself with the content beforehand so that you are not dependent on the text.
 •The dialogue cards 1-13 are common for all target audiences and can be shown to all 
of them. Dialogue card 14 is for children between 6-59 months, dialogue card 15 is for 
children between 5-9 years, dialogue card 16 is for adolescents between 10-19 years, 
dialogue card 17 is for WRA, dialogue card 18 is for pregnant women, and dialogue card 
19 is for breastfeeding mothers and can be shown specifically to those target audiences or 
their caregivers, as appropriate. 
Booklets, like the 4 Mantra booklet for adolescents are designed to 
reinforce or support information given verbally by the functionary . 
If used properly, they will strengthen the messages that you give to 
adolescents. 
The following are suggestions on how to use booklets (this material 
can primarily be used by AFHC counsellors):
 •Go through each page of the booklet with the adolescent. This will give you a chance to show and tell about a problem 
or practice and answer any questions that the adolescent 
has.
 •Point to the pictures and not the text. This will help the adolescent to remember what the illustrations represent.
 •Assess the adolescent’s reactions. If s/he looks puzzled or worried, then discuss the worries or ask questions. Discussions will help establish a good relationship and build trust between you and the adolescent. A person who has confidence 
in her/his health service provider will often transfer that confidence to the method or health 
practice selected.
 •Give the booklet to the adolescent. Suggest that s/he share it with others, even if the adolescent makes a decision not to adopt the health practice described. 

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module60HOW TO USE PLAYING CARDS
HOW TO USE PAMPHLETBefore you begin the game, read the 
instructions provided on the box of the 
playing cards carefully and then conduct 
the session. The cards can be played with 
different audiences that are literate and

them in the audience. All the participants 
should have an equal number of cards. Then, 
conduct the session as per the instructions 
provided on the box.
The pamphlet can be distributed to community 
members who visit the facility for them to read 
at their own pace. The pamphlet provides 
a detailed description of the causes, signs 
and symptoms of anemia, its prevention and control and do’s and don’ts. It can be used 
effectively as an IEC material for people 
who can read. It can be distributed among 
community members during PMSMA events 
and immunization events. It can also be given 
during home visits after reminding about the 
information given during a session.The recipe booklet provides information on the 
various iron-rich recipes that can be prepared 
such as poha, barfi, laddoos, chaat etc. using 
locally available ingredients such as spinach, 
bajra, soya flour, peanuts, jaggery etc. You can 
share the recipes with women who visit the health 
facility and engage them in conversations about 
their cooking preferences. You can inform them 
that these recipes are easy and the meals are 
tasty and can be enjoyed by the entire family . You 
can discuss recipes they like from the booklet and also give them a copy for their own reference.

stra tegyBackground
Anemia is widespread across most age groups and across all states in the country . As per NFHS-4, 
every second person in the continuum of care (children-adolescents-women of reproductive age-
pregnant and lactating women) in the country is anemic. Emerging experience from the field shows 
that inadequate infrastructure, lack of training of personnel, issues in procurement and distribution 
of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA), irregular and random supplies to pharmacies at the district and block 
level and lack of reliable data on distribution and consumption are major hindrances in the entire 
ecosystem of IFA service delivery . 
The Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy plans to build upon the learning of implementing the 
National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) and Weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS) programmes. 
The strategic 6x6x6 intervention proposed under AMB focuses on ensuring services to six target beneficiaries on six interventions via six institutional mechanisms. One of the key institutional 
mechanisms under the strategy is to strengthen the procurement and supply chain mechanisms. 
450 million  
beneficiaries – nearly 
50% of the country’s 
population will be 
reached
Rationale
Many of the districts in the country are experiencing chronic shortages in IFA supplies in the last few 
years. Random distribution of IFA as per availability at the State level, erratic reporting, irregular stock 
audits, centralized forecast and estimation of supplies, poor knowledge on practice of indents and 
floating demands have led to an increase in the existing demand-supply gap for IFA. 
To ensure seamless (upstream and downstream) delivery of IFA at the state level, bottlenecks in IFA 
procurement, deliveries, quality control, storage, disposal and distribution have to be addressed and a 
robust system of documentation, monitoring and training of personnel has to be established across 
key stakeholders [(Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Ministry of Human Resource 
Development (MHRD) and Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD)] via effective intra and 
inter-ministerial convergence.
IFA Supply Chain Management Manual for Programme Managers and Service Providers is aimed at 
empowering users to adopt innovative strategies to establish and/or strengthen the existing supply 
chain management system at the States. It attempts to inform stakeholders about the strategic 
approach and types of investments needed to move from one stage to the next with the ultimate aim 
to integrate the existing supply chain management system under the AMB strategy .Fig 1: 6x6x6 Intervention

MANAGEMENT
Supply chain management: Organogram
In order to understand the gaps and to address issues in the existing IFA supply chain management, 
it is imperative to define the internal structure and units involved to ascertain the relationship 
amongst various departments, levels, teams as well as individuals. Setting up a Supply Chain 
Management organogram will help improve visibility across the chain of events, define the line of 
command, flow of authority and information from top to bottom and otherwise.

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module72IFA SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESS
 Step 1:  Planning and forecasting
The process of calculating target beneficiaries and forecasting supplies for the target population may 
be made more participatory and inclusive by involving the district in calculating target beneficiaries 
and involving the block in estimating the requirement of drugs based on population and coverage.
Objective: To identify missed opportunities and ensure increased supply and coverage of 
IFA (Red, Pink, Blue and Syrup) for all age groups under AMB via Sub Centres, AWCs and schools.
Estimating the target population (denominators) is as follows:
Children (6-59 months) Who:	Nodal	Officer	–	Child	Health 
Where:  State and District level 
How:  As per Census 2011 estimations 
Data Compilation:  District → State
Children (5-10 years) Who:	Nodal	Officer	–	Child	Health

Data Compilation:  Block→District→State
*= States opting for 100% population of WRA may specify the annual target for deciding on WRA 
denominator for AMB Dashboard
  Step 2:   Indent (at the State and district level)
The process of indent differs between districts and blocks. To streamline the process following 
actions should be ensured.
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module73Objective: To ensure that at every level of service delivery, an indent plan for IFA Red 
(pregnant, 	lactating	women	and	WRA	group	–	Mission	Parivar	 Vikas)	and	 Albendazole	for	
pregnant women, IFA syrup for children aged 6-59 months, IFA Pink for children aged 5-9 
years, IFA Blue for adolescents aged 10-19 years are available around the year.Estimate annual 
indents for target population (District and Block) including 
buffer stock

1. ESTIMATION OF IFA RED AND ALBENDAZOLE FOR PREGNANT AND 
LACTATING WOMEN
IFA Red
Annually, if there are 10,000 pregnant women registered and 9,000 live births reported under 
HMIS in a district, the requirement of IFA for pregnant women (considering 50% of them are 
anemic in the state) and lactating mothers will be as follows:
A	–	Half	number	of 	pregnant	women	as	per	HMIS*180	tablets	=	5000*180	=	9,00,000
B	–	Half	number	of 	pregnant	women	as	per	HMIS*360	tablets	=	5000*360	=	18,00,000
C	–	Number	of 	live	births	as	per	HMIS*180	tablets	=	9,000*180	=	16,20,000
D	–	10	%	Buffer	stock	=	(9,00,000	+	18,00,000	+	16,20,000)*0.1	=	4,32,000Total Requirement = (A + B + C + D) = (9,00,000 + 18,00,000 + 16,20,000 + 4,32,000) = 
47,52,000In case if the state has 10,00,000 stock in hand left and 5,00,000 stock in pipe line.  
The total final requirement will be Total Requirement- (stock in hand+ stock in pipe line)= 47, 52,000-(10,00,000+5,00,000)= 
32,52,000
Albendazole for pregnant women
A	–	Number	of 	registered	pregnancies	as	per	HMIS	=	10,000
B	–	Number	of 	tablets	required	=	1	per	pregnancy
Total Requirement = A*B = 10,000*1 =10,000
Note: Estimation of number of anemic pregnant women may vary from state to state depending on 
the anemia prevalence as per NFHS-4
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module762. ESTIMATION OF IFA BLUE FOR SCHOOL GOING ADOLESCENTS
IFA Blue
Say for an academic year, a district has 10,000 adolescents (10-19 year old girls and boys) 
registered in school of which 7,000 are boys and 3,000 are girls in the district. The requirement 
of IFA blue will be as follows:
In school adolescents (girls and boys)
Tablets required for prophylactic dose
A	–	Number	of 	adolescents	in	school	=	10,000*52=	5,20,000
Tablets required for therapeutic doseB	–	Anemic	adolescent	girls	identified	in	school	(estimated	to	be	50%)	to	be	given	therapeutic	
dose of two IFA blue tablets once daily for 90 days  (3months)
Therefore, B = 50% of 3,000 = 1,500 = (1,500*2)*90= 2,70,000C	–	Anemic	adolescent	boys	identified	in	school	(estimated	to	be	29%)	to	be	given	therapeutic	
dose of two IFA blue tablets once daily for 90 days  (3 months)
Therefore, C= 29% of 7,000= 2,030= (2,030*2)*90= 3,65,400Note: To avoid overestimation, the buffer stock estimate should be adjusted with the total 
prophylactic dose required (A) as it includes prophylactic dose estimates for anemic 
adolescents also. 
Total requirement= (A+B+C)= 5,20,000+2,70,000+3,65,400= 11,55,400
In case if the state has 2,00,000 stock in hand left and 1,00,000 stock in pipe line. The 
total final requirement will be 
Total Requirement- (stock in hand+ stock in pipe line)= 11,55,400-(2,00,000+1,00,000)= 
8,55,400
Note: Estimation of number of anemic adolescent girls and boys may vary from state to state 
depending on the anemia prevalence as per NFHS-4
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module773. ESTIMATION OF IFA PINK FOR 5-9 YEAR OLD IN SCHOOL AND OUT 
OF SCHOOL CHILDREN
IFA Pink
Say for an academic year, a district has 10,000 children (5-9 year old girls and boys) registered 
in school of which 7,000 are boys, 3,000 are girls and 200 children are out of school. The 
requirement of IFA blue will be as follows:
In school children, 5-9 years old (girls and boys)
Tablets required for prophylactic dose
A	–	Number	of 	children	in	school	=	(10,000*52)	=	5,20,000
Tablets required for therapeutic dose: Anemic 5-9 year old girls and boys identified in school 
(estimated to be 50%) to be given therapeutic dose of 3 mg iron/kg/day for 2 months. 
Note: The average weight of 5-9 year old children ranges from 15-20 kgs. Hence, one tab of 45 
mg iron and 400 mcg folic acid can be given once daily for 60 days (2 months) as therapeutic 
dose.
Therefore, B = 50% of 10,000 = 5,000 = (5000*1)*60 = 3,00,000Total requirement for in school children (C)= A+B = 5, 20,000+3,00,000= 8,20,000Note: To avoid overestimation, buffer stock estimate should be adjusted with the total prophylactic 
dose required (A) as it includes prophylactic dose estimates for anemic children also.
Out of school children, 5-9 years old (girls and boys)Tablets required for prophylactic doseD	–	Number	of 	out	of	school	children	=	(200*52)	=	10,400
Tablets required for therapeutic dose: Anemic 5-9 year old out of school girls and boys 
identified (estimated to be 50%) to be given therapeutic dose of 3 mg iron/kg/day for 2 months.
Note: The average weight of 5-9 year old children ranges from 15-20 kgs. Hence, one tab of 45 
mg iron and 400 mcg folic acid can be given once daily for 60 days (2 months) as therapeutic 
dose.
Therefore, E = 50% of 200 = 100 = (100*1)*60 = 6,000Total Requirement for out of school children (F) = D+E= 10,400+6000= 16,400
Total requirement= (C+F)= (8,20,000+16,400) = 8,36,400
Note: To avoid overestimation, buffer stock estimate should be adjusted with the total prophylactic 
dose required (A) as it includes prophylactic dose estimates for anemic children also. 
In case if the state has 2,00,000 stock in hand left and 1,00,000 stock in pipe line. The total 
final requirement will be  
Total Requirement- (stock in hand+ stock in pipe line)= 8,36,000-(2,00,000+1,00,000 )= 5,36,000
Note: Estimation of number of anemic 5-9 year old children may vary from state to state depending 
on the anemia prevalence as per NFHS-4

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module80 Step 4:  Distribution
Objective: To ensure timely and adequate distribution of supplies till the last mile i.e. Sub 
Centres, VHNDs and schools.
i. Before initiating distribution:
 •Identify the supply delivery facilities and the distribution route
 •Define the distribution cycle (monthly, quarterly, biannually) and ascertain the 
quantity of supplies to be distributed to each delivery point (based on the indent request)
 •Update DVDMS/e-Aushadhi and HMIS to maintain track of supplies (receipt, distribution) and stock-at-hand details respectively
ii. Identify the stock delivery points receiving supplies:
 •District/Block drug ware houses and health facilities dispensing products to end users should be identified as stock delivery points
 •Tracking of monthly consumption of supplies at the stock delivery points should be done
iii. Tracking of supplies:
 •Bottom up tracking of supplies at the stock delivery points should be done to estimate consumption. For e.g. Block drug store should track the monthly stock 
supplied to the health facilities (SC,PHC, Schools, AWC etc.) in its vicinity and 
district drug store should track the stocks supplied to the block drug stores 
respectively . 
iv. Identify facilities:
The facility list should contain information about each facility (including store houses) in the supply chain. In addition to the facility code and contact person, the list should have 
the following information for each facility:
 •Type of facility (for example, State/Regional/District Warehouse, Block 
Pharmacy, health facility, State/District government office etc.) 
 •Function of the facility (for example, warehouse, health facility or both) 
 •List of drugs in stock (IFA Red, Blue, Pink Syrup, Albendazole etc.)
 •Minimum and maximum months’ worth of stock
v. Identify product category:
It is essential to define the category of IFA to be tracked by assigning unique product category codes, specification of the product and the minimum shipment amount from the 
central supplier. 
To ensure seamless and smooth functioning of all activities linked with logistics of 
supply chain management, the following components have to be ensured: 
 5Each facility receives products from one—and only one—supply link. 
 5Products are distributed only to facilities at the next level in the supply chain. 
 5All facilities report on the same software or on traditional reporting formats. 
 5Reports are submitted to the linked health facility (PHC, CHC etc.), which can 
then electronically submit the data to the district or state level.
Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module81 Step 5:  Reporting
The reporting of stock position has to be maintained on a monthly basis in the HMIS. At every level 
of health facility, entry on the stock position has to be recorded by the concerned service provider/
programme manager and validated by the officer in-charge. 
The mechanism for reporting supply distribution and coverage data from schools is depicted in the 
diagram below:

Fig 4: Solid lines: Flow of supplies Dotted line: Flow of information (coverage data) 5Reporting is relatively complete, timely, and accurate. 
 5Facilities report beginning stock levels, receipts, issues and adjustments for each product during each reporting period
vi. Identify the delivery vehicle:
Define the capacity of delivery vehicles in the distribution system and decide which vehicle to assign to a particular route in accordance with cargo volume and vehicle capacity .
vii. Define delivery routes:
After identifying the delivery vehicle and delivery personnel,
 •Locate each health facility to ensure last mile delivery within the distribution network. 
 •Create a distribution network with identified distribution routes, facilities assigned, 
specified distance and traveling time between each facility in the route and between 
each facility and distribution center.
Facility wise historical distribution of supplies data can be obtained by timely and complete 
data entry in the inventory management system (DVDMS/e-Aushadhi etc.)
In case of stock-out:
 •Identify the facility most in need of resupply and request for an indent
 •Based on the consumption pattern, estimate the actual quantity to be delivered to the 
facility
 •Stocks can be deviated to the facility in need from facilities reporting surplus (based 
on their consumption pattern)
 •This will maximize the effectiveness of limited delivery resources by scheduling deliveries according to need

Denominator
“The denominators are the target beneficiary numbers across each age group of AMB. These 
denominators are estimations (based on Census 2011 data) and reported programme targets. 
The denominators for each of these target groups are fixed for the FY and no edits of the data are 
allowed in the back end.”

Anemia Mukt Bharat Training Module107Process of Coverage Data Updated in AMB Dashboard
Data is being uploaded quarterly on the AMB portal. Each quarter is defined as Q1 (April to June), 
Q2 (July to September), Q3 (October to December) and 
Q4 (January to March). The used numerators are from 
the HMIS Standard report generated from the HMIS 
portal. The HMIS Standard report is downloaded after 
one and half month completion of each quarter because 
of reporting done after completion of each month and 
compiled after 15 days. Thereafter data cleaning to 
remove non-reporting is performed on downloaded 
data according to the requirement of the AMB portal. 
Based on the cleaned data, a Data Entry Sheet (DES) is 
prepared and uploaded on the AMB portal. The percentage 
calculation based on the denominator is an automated 
process performed by pre-defined jobs. Thus the computed 
percentage data is shown on the AMB portal.Prepare
